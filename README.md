### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science Student at the University of Oklahoma expecting to graduate in Fall 2024. I'm a Software Developer 1 at O'Reilly Auto Parts where I have been since May 2023. Outside of work I enjoy working on personal projects, learning new languages/problem solving techniques, and helping others learn how to code.
