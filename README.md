# Hi there, I'm Preston 👋

<br>

I'm a **Software Engineer** and a current **M.S. in Computer Science student at Georgia Institute of Technology** 🐝.

I'm passionate about building software that solves real-world problems. I'm driven by a constant desire to learn new things and build robust, scalable applications - the kind of engineering that keeps our digital world running.

- 🎓 I'm currently learning to balance my full-time engineering role with my graduate studies
- 🌱 I'm always learning and exploring new technologies and concepts
- 🚀 I love building side projects to try out new ideas (currently tinkering with a new app!)

### 💻 My Tech Stack

My primary tools of choice are **Java** and the **JavaScript/TypeScript** ecosystem, but I'm always open to learning new things.
